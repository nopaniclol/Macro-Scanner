No, that code won't work in BQuant (or any Jupyter notebook environment) because __file__ is not defined in Jupyter notebooks.

The __file__ variable only exists when running Python scripts (.py files), but in Jupyter notebooks, there's no equivalent built-in variable.

What happens when you try:
import os
print(__file__)  # This will raise a NameError in Jupyter
Alternatives for BQuant/Jupyter:
1. Use os.getcwd() for current directory:
import sys
import os

# Get current working directory instead of __file__
current_dir = os.getcwd()
src_path = os.path.join(current_dir, '..', 'src')
sys.path.insert(0, src_path)
2. Use %pwd magic command:
import sys
import os

# Get current directory using Jupyter magic
current_dir = %pwd
src_path = os.path.join(current_dir, '..', 'src')
sys.path.insert(0, src_path)
3. Hardcode the path (if structure is known):
import sys

# Directly specify the path relative to your notebook location
sys.path.insert(0, '../src')
4. Use pathlib for cleaner path handling:
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Get current directory and navigate to src
current_dir = Path.cwd()
src_path = current_dir.parent / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(src_path))
However, remember that in BQuant you're primarily working with notebooks, so the %run magic command is usually the most effective way to share code between notebooks!
